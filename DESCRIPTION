Title: Functions for Timing R Scripts, as Well as Implementations of "Stack"
    and "StackList" Structures
Version: 1.2
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@jabiruventures.com>
Description: Code execution timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that
    can be nested. One can record all timings while a complex script is
    running, and examine the values later. It is also possible to instrument
    the timing calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this package provides
    class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'StackList', which is a
    stack implemented as a
    list, both of which support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first_element',
    'last_element' and 'clear'.
